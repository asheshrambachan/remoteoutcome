Description: Implements nonparametric methods for estimating treatment effects
    when outcomes are measured using remotely sensed variables (RSVs) such as
    satellite images or mobile phone data. Based on Rambachan, Singh, and Viviano (2025)
    "Program Evaluation with Remotely Sensed Outcomes" <arXiv:2411.10959>. The package
    provides estimators that combine experimental and observational samples under a
    stability assumption, allowing for valid inference without rate conditions on
    machine learning predictions.
